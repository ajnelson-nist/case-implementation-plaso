- Why is `fileSystemType` in both `File` and `FileSystem` property bundles? How do they work again?
- I'm having issues trying to fit all the timestamps created by plaso. 
- When I have the name and phone number of a phone call do I set the sender as a PhoneAccount or Contact?  Since I have a name as well it seems like I should do Contact because PhoneAccount only has a field for contact.. but I thought PhoneAccount would be more appropriate?
